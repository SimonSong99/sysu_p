<h4>Kehai Liu, Shuyi Ma, Zhanjun Wu, Yuebin Zheng, Xiaoxi Qu, Yishou Wang, and Wenhua Wu</h4>
<h4>SHM  2016</h4>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Review</h3>
<p>  The paper introduced a weight-compensated probability-based diagnostic imaging (WCPDI) approach to improve the accuracy of damage localization in structural health monitoring (SHM). By proposing a new unit weight distribution to estimate the elliptical distribution of weight, the influence of weight distribution dominance was reduced, and thus the precision of damage localization of the WCPDI algorithm was significantly improved compared to the conventional PDI algorithm.

<h4>IEEE  2023</h4>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Review</h3>
<p>  Probabilistic diagnostic imaging (PDI) method has been confirmed to be promising in structural health monitoring (SHM). The imaging capability of PDI method is limited by numerous factors, including the selection of probability distribution function and ellipsoidal scaling factor, the density of sensing arrays, and the damage index. <br>
  The author proposed a modifed delay-factor-basde multiply-sum PDI (MDF-MSPDI) algorithm. In which the author obtains a more accurate delay factor (DF) by improving the culculation method of the group velocity of wave, and therefore the independence of gloabal accuracy on the selection of scaling factor <em>β</em> was reduced. At the same time, this study proposed an multiply–sum (MS)
operation to reconstruct the damage imaging of each path, and generally reduce the dependence on individual paths, which can greatly improve the imaging accuracy of PDI method.

<h4>Chao Zhou, Zhongqing Su, Li Cheng</h4>
<h4>MSSP  2011</h4>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Review</h3>
<p>   In recognition of the deficiencies of most approaches using elastic waves for quantitatively identifying orientation specific damage (a crack or a notch), intensity of crack-scattered wave signal energy subject to different angles of wave incidence was investigated and calibrated, which was integrated with temporal information extracted from captured wave signals. <br>
   Based on this, a retrofitted probability-based diagnostic imaging approach was developed, in which a two-level synthetic image fusion scheme was introduced to enhance robustness and tolerance to measurement noise/uncertainties and possible erroneous perceptions from particular sensing paths and therefore the accuracy of this approach was significantly improved.

<h3>Review</h3>
<p>   The paper proposed a baseline-free time reversal probabilistic imaging (BFTRPI) algorithm for damage monitoring using Lamb waves, in which the time reversal principle was utilized to reconstruct structural response signals and eliminate the dispersion effect of Lamb waves. Therefore the algorithm could effectively identify multiple damages and significantly improve the accuracy of damage location compared with the traditional PDI method.

<h3>Review</h3>
<p>   In this paper, aiming at the contact delamination damage detection of anisotropic composite plates, a non-elliptical probability imaging (NEPI) method using a sparse sensor network based on nonlinear ultrasonic guided waves was proposed. The time coefficient (CT) and nonlinear damage index (NDI) based on smooth pseudo Wigner–Ville distribution (SPWVD) are defined and applied in the NEPI, which greatly improved the detection ability of the method for delamination damage compared with other damage detection methods.

<h3>Review</h3>
<p>   The authors introduce a special method to calculate the time-of-flight (ToF) by dividing the plate into small grids and summing the distances between each grid. And therefore the use of the RAPID algorithm with a structural weight function for defect identification in non-uniform section plates (NUSPs) was proposed, which  can considerably improve the precision of the localization, and the shape of the high-damage probability area, compared with the conventional RAPID.

<h4>Chuang Hei, Mingzhang Luo, Panpan Gong, and Gangbing Song</h4>
<h4>SMS  2020</h4>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Review</h3>
<p>   This study proposes an innovative method to monitor a bolted connection by using a single piezoceramic transducer enabled coda wave energy (CWE), in which the backscatter wave (coda wave) of the stress wave signal was employed  to evaluate the changes of magnitude of the pre-tightening force on the bolt. Hence, the effect of PZT aging was eliminated and the number of transducers and connecting lines, which improved the practical applicability of the method and reduce the overall cost of bolted connection monitoring, respectively.

<p><br></p>
<h3>Review</h3>
<p>   This paper discussed the propagation characteristics and potential applications of the fundamental ultrasonic edge wave mode (ES0) for distant damage detection in engineering structures.
<br>
   The transient ES0 mode was studied experimentally and numerically, and its features were compared with previous theoretical studies. The paper demonstrated that the ES0 mode can be effectively excited with the wedge excitation method and can propagate several meters with minimal decay at low frequency-thickness values. However, at higher frequency-thickness values, wave amplitude modulation, energy decay, and strong coupling between the ES0 and S0 wave modes were observed, which might limit defect resolution and the range of damage inspections.

<h3>Review</h3>
<p>   This paper introduced the real-time implementation of an empirical mode decomposition (EMD) algorithm for ultrasonic nondestructive testing (NDT) applications.

   The authors presented the implementation of the EMD algorithm using piecewise linear interpolation (PLI) and cubic spline interpolation (CSI) methods, and subsequently discussed the use of partial reconstruction algorithm for signal filtering, baseline correction, and noise filtering. In addition, the author suggested that the end distortion of IMF and residual signals was caused by improper handling of the initial signal end points. The authors also set up noise comparison groups of different sizes to prove the noise reduction ability of EMD method.
<br>
   The practical results showed that the real-time implementation of the EMD algorithm improved the time domain resolution of ultrasonic A-scan raw data and enhanced the signal-to-noise ratio for the visualization and identification of ultrasonic pulse-echo signals in real-time.

<h4>Eaglekumar G. Tarpara and V. H. Patankar</h4>
<h4>IEEE Access  2021</h4>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Review</h3>
<p>   The paper proposed an improved wavelet threshold algorithm for denoising ultrasonic signals in the electric multiple unit (EMU) wheel trackside fault diagnosis system. The algorithm combined the advantages of soft and hard threshold functions, providing a smooth transition near the threshold. The proposed sinusoidal threshold function exhibited continuity, graduality, and high-order differentiability, which was verified that could outperform the classical soft and hard threshold functions in terms of signal-to-noise ratio and effectively reduce noise and preserve the original signal characteristics, facilitating defect location and characterization in ultrasonic nondestructive testing.

<h4>Ming Hong, Zhongqing Su, Qiang Wang, Li Cheng, and Xinlin Qing</h4>
<h4>Ultrasonics  2014</h4>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Review</h3>
<p>   This paper discussed a modeling technique for understanding the nonlinear characteristics of ultrasonic waves in a fatigued medium. The technique took into account the nonlinearities originating from material, fatigue damage, and the "breathing" motion of fatigue cracks,  and then was validated experimentally, which showed that it can accurately simulate fatigue crack-incurred nonlinearities in ultrasonic waves. The study also revealed that there was a cumulative growth of the acoustic nonlinearity parameter with increasing wave propagation distance and that this parameter was nonlinearly related to the offset distance from the fatigue crack.

<h4>Journal of Sound and Vibration  2021</h4>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Review</h3>
<p>   This paper proposed a method for analyzing the guided wave propagation characteristics of the turnout straight switch rail with variable cross-section and verified the effectiveness of the method through finite element simulation and field experiments. The results showed that the dispersion characteristics of the turnout straight switch rail change slowly along the longitudinal direction, and that at a local level, the dispersion characteristics were similar to rail of constant cross-section. Based on this, a three-dimensional dispersion surface with cross-sectional position information was proposed, and the variation regularity of dispersion characteristics along the longitudinal direction was analyzed.

<p><br></p>
<h3>Review</h3>
<p>   The paper presented the use of the semi-analytical finite element method to compute wavenumber versus frequency curves and investigate mode repulsion and mode crossing. The authors identified a term causing repulsion between two modes and established a condition for two modes to cross, and concluded with an experimental measurement illustrating mode repulsion subsequently.
In a symmetric rail model there is no repulsion force between symmetric and antisymmetric modes and these will cross. If a small asymmetry is introduced in the rail profile there are no longer symmetric and antisymmetric modes and all modes appear to repel.

<h4>Dineo A. Ramatlo, Craig S. Long, Philip W. Loveday, Daniel N. Wilke</h4>
<h4>Journal of Sound and Vibration  2022</h4>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Review</h3>
<p>   The authors proposed two numerical procedures to model and simulate guided wave inspections, specifically focusing on reverberating reflections. 
<br>
   The first one is based on simple manual simulation of finite reverberating reflections, while the second method is based on a general scattering matrix computation, and accounts for infinite reverberations. 
<br>
   The first method allowed for the interpretation of results and understanding of how different reflections interact, while the second method provided a more accurate approximation by accounting for scattering from all defects or discontinuities in the waveguide. 
<br>
   The simulation results obtained from these procedures were validated using a field experiment.

<h3>Review</h3>
<p>   The paper discussed the estimation of rail properties using semi-analytical finite element models and guided wave ultrasound measurements. And an automated procedure was developed to estimate the material and geometric properties of a rail by finding the properties that accurately reproduce measured dispersion characteristics when input into a Semi-Analytical Finite Element (SAFE) model.
<br>
    The SAFE method was used to solve the forward problem of predicting dispersion characteristics for specified rail properties. Therefore a technique was developed to determine the best fit between the SAFE model and the experimental measurements. It was demonstrated that the estimated rail parameters produced dispersion curves and distances that were in good agreement with the measured spectrograms.

The model combines a 3D FEM model of a piezoelectric transducer with a 2D SAFE model of the rail to simulate the excitation, propagation, and scattering of guided waves from welds. In which, optimal damping parameters were determined using a model updating procedure to approximate attenuation in the rail.

<h4>Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing  2022</h4>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Review</h3>
<p>   This paper discussed the assessment of wheel conditions in high-speed trains under various operational conditions using semi-supervised adversarial domain adaptation. The authors proposed an adversarial domain adaptation approach to transfer knowledge from a well-controlled monitoring test in one rail section to the rail section of interest. The approach was modified to be semi-supervised, as the data in the target domain could be labeled as "intact" for new or reprofiled components. The authors conducted two-level marginal and conditional domain adaptation to eliminate the distribution discrepancy induced by operational differences between the rail sections. 
<br>
   The approach was validated using onboard monitoring data from the high-speed rail section and the results demonstrated the effectiveness of the approach and its superiority over three baseline models.

<h3>Review</h3>
<p>   This paper introduced a new method for the rapid detection of cracks in the rail foot using ultrasonic B-scan imaging and a shear horizontal (SH)-guided wave electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT). 
<br>
   The authors proposed a finite element method (FEM) based on the Bloch-Floquet boundary and domain constraint to calculate the dispersion curves of SH-guided waves propagating in the rail foot and then developed an SH-guided wave EMAT. The ultrasonic B-scan imaging was performed in the rail foot to detect straight cracks. The synchro squeezed wavelet transform (SWT) method is used to remove noise and higher-order guided wave modes from the detected signals.

<h3>Review</h3>
<p>   The paper introduced a structural health monitoring (SHM) framework based on actively generated diffuse ultrasonic waves (DUWs) and a benchmark-free condition contrast algorithm. The DUWs are generated and acquired using miniaturized lead zirconate titanate (PZT) wafers, and their propagation characteristics are used to quantitatively characterize fatigue cracks in the tracks and evaluate the overall health status of the tracks in real-time. The DUW-driven inspection philosophy offered advantages such as immunity to ambient noise, reduced dependence on baseline signals, and high robustness in challenging engineering conditions. 
<br>
   The proposed SHM framework was validated through conformance tests on HSR tracks, demonstrating its effectiveness, adaptability, reliability, and robustness for HSR applications.

The covariance matrix of each mode was established to determine the best excitation point. The response to the excitation in the rail can be computed using the SAFE method. 
<br>
   The proposed method was verified to successfully excite a specific ultrasonic-guided wave mode at low and high frequencies.

<h4>Juncen Wu, Hongwei Hu, Yongfeng Song, Duo Lyu, Xiongbing Li</h4>
<h4>NDT and E International  2023</h4>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Review</h3>
<p>   This study discusses the development of an enhanced imaging algorithm called AC-AA-ENPSM (Attenuation Compensation-Anti-Aliasing-Extended Non-Stationary Phase Shift Migration) for ultrasonic phased array testing of components with irregular surfaces. 
<br>
   The proposed algorithm combined attenuation compensation and anti-aliasing techniques to address the negative effects of attenuation during ultrasonic wave propagation in metals and the jagged medium interface determined by traditional rectangular windows. The attenuation term was measured through immersion testing with referenced samples, and an anti-aliasing technique was used to smooth the spatial velocity distribution. 
<br>
   Experiments were conducted on objects with irregular surfaces and varying attenuation characteristics. The results show that the proposed AC-AA-ENPSM algorithm has a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to traditional ENPSM and a computational efficiency at least 40 times higher than the total Focusing Method (TFM) algorithm.

<h3>Review</h3>
<p>   This paper discussed the use of phased array ultrasonics for real-time monitoring of the weld pool during the deposition of multi-pass gas tungsten arc welds. 
<br>
   The paper demonstrated that phased array ultrasonics could provide information about key physical transitions in the welding process, such as melting and solidification of the weldment. The technique is also effective in determining weld quality in real-time, with significant signal changes indicating the presence of defects. The authors emphasize the accurate focusing and steering capabilities of phased arrays, which allow for the isolation of the molten weld pool from the surrounding solidified material.

<h4>Chunguang Piao, Jeseung Lee, Sung Hyun Kim, Yoon Young Kim</h4>
<h4>NDT and E International  2024</h4>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Review</h3>
<p>   This paper discussed a non-invasive ultrasonic inspection method for detecting sludge accumulation in plastic pipes. 
<br>
   The existing method could only detect sludge when its height is larger than 1/5 of the pipe diameter. The proposed method, involving generating an L wave, converting it to an S wave, transmitting it to the pipe wall, and converting it back to an L wave in the fluid, used different wave modes in different media along the wave passage to accurately estimate the height of the sludge. The authors designed a meta-slab mode-converting wedge using a PEEK-based metamaterial for the full-power L-to-S mode conversion. 
<br>
   Numerical simulations and experiments were conducted to validate the proposed method, and the results showed that the detectable heights of the accumulated sludge were considerably lower than those of the existing approach.

<h3>Review</h3>
<p>   The paper presented a novel ultrasonic inspection method for heat exchangers (HE) based on circumferential waves (CW) and deep neural networks (DNN).

   The authors proposed using thin patch-type piezoelectric elements with multiple resonance frequencies for the ultrasonic inspection of narrow-spaced HEs in an immersion test. The water-filled HE was used to simulate defective HE, as water leakage is a reliable indicator of defects. The authors used continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to analyze the received CW and separate frequency bands corresponding to the thickness and lateral resonance modes of the piezoelectric element.

<h4>Ultrasonics  2023</h4>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Review</h3>
<p>   The current imaging methods for structural damage characterization and visualization often result in artifacts, large spots, and false imaging due to the high accuracy required in wave packet information extraction. 
<br>
   To address this issue, the proposed method transformed the damage imaging problem into a scattering sources search problem. The fitness function was defined as the number of imaging trajectories through potential scattering sources, and it was implemented in a particle swarm optimization algorithm to iteratively search for actual scattering sources. The location of the damage can be identified by observing the distribution of the population. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately locates crack damage and delamination damage in composites, outperforming the elliptic imaging method.

<h4>Composite Structures  2023</h4>

<h3>Review</h3>
<p>   This paper discussed a method for damage imaging of composite structures using Lamb waves and signal processing techniques. The authors highlighted the challenges of imaging composite materials due to their anisotropy and complexity, which could result in artifacts and inaccurate results. To address these issues, they proposed a weighted delay-and-sum (DAS) imaging method based on denoising autoencoder (DAE) learning. The DAS algorithm was modified to be compatible with anisotropic materials, and a DAE is used to extract efficient features and remove noise from the ultrasonic signals. 
<br>
   Experimental tests on various composite structures confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method in suppressing noise and enhancing damage localization accuracy.

<h4>Composite Structures  2023</h4>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Review</h3>
<p>   This paper discussed a method for detecting and imaging delamination damage in carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) composite laminate structures. 
<br>
   Conventional detection methods relied on reflected wave signals, but these signals were weak compared to surface damage, making delamination detection challenging. The proposed method uses full-wavefield data and focuses on incident waves rather than reflected waves. It weakened the original A0 mode and enhanced sensitive modes in the wavefield data to image the delamination. The method was tested on simulated data and experimental results, demonstrating its effectiveness in visualizing delamination damage morphology.

<h4>Juan Carlos Pineda Allen, Ching Tai Ng</h4>
<h4>Composite Structures  2023</h4>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Review</h3>
<p>   This paper discussed a delamination damage detection technique in composite laminates using nonlinear guided wave mixing. 
<br>
   The approach involved using a network of transducers to sequentially scan the structure by actuating and receiving dual guided waves. The interaction of the incident dual frequency wave with the damage generated combined frequency waves, which were used to locate and determine the damage location. The proposed damage localization imaging algorithm analyzed the cross-correlation of the signal envelope at combined frequency wave with the excitation pulse envelope at incident waves for each transducer pair. 
<br>
   A numerical study using an experimentally validated finite element model is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed technique. The results show that the method can effectively predict the damage location and does not require baseline measurements, making it a potential baseline-free damage detection technique.

<h4>Esmaeil Mirmahdi, Ramin Khamedi, Davood Afshari, Mehdi Khosravi</h4>
<h4>Journal of Pipeline Science and Engineering  2023</h4>

<h3>Review</h3>
<p>   The paper investigated the effects of defects and geometric anisotropy in stainless steel pipes using phased array ultrasonic testing (PAUT). 
<br>
   The study focused on detecting defects, especially corrosion defects, using an increased number of probes in PAUT. The results showed that increasing the number of probes and their elements leads to more accurate detection of defects, even small-sized ones. Additionally, the study examined the geometric anisotropy of horizontally polarized shear waves (SH-waves) in stainless steel pipes. The findings revealed that the speed on the outer surface of the pipe was higher than the generatrix due to the isotropic properties of the pipe material. 
<br>
   The experimental tests demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting and measuring defects in stainless steel pipes. The use of four probes simultaneously improves the accuracy of defect detection.

<h3>Review</h3>
<p>   This paper discussed the numerical and experimental analysis of low frequency ultrasonic guided wave propagation through honeycomb core sandwich structures with non-uniform core thickness. 
<br>
   The use of guided wave-based inspections for non-destructive evaluation (NDE) of these structures had gained attention in the aerospace and marine industries. The paper presented the analysis of guided wave propagation through a tapered honeycomb sandwich structure using a low frequency fundamental antisymmetric mode. Numerical simulations using 3D finite element analysis and experiments on a portion of a helicopter blade were conducted to determine the global guided waves (GGWs) and the continuous variation of local wave properties such as wavenumber, group velocity, and phase speed. Polynomial fits were presented for the variation of group velocity along the propagation direction, and a method for predicting the time of flight (ToF) using a non-uniform group velocity is outlined. 
<br>
   The findings demonstrated the potential use of these methods in wave-based NDE of tapered honeycomb core sandwich structures.<br></p>
